# Random Walks on Complex Fractals  

## Overview  
This project explores **random walks on complex fractals**, focusing on the **Sierpiński Triangle** and the **Dragon Curve**. Random walks on fractals reveal intriguing mathematical properties, including non-standard scaling, self-similarity, and anomalous diffusion. This project implements algorithms to simulate random walks on these fractals and analyze their behavior.
